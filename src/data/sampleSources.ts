    title: "Nietzsche on Magnanimity, Greatness, and Greatness of Soul",
    abstract:
      "This chapter brings Nietzsche into dialogue with the tradition of thinking about the virtue of magnanimity. In a few places in his work, Nietzsche uses the German Großmuth (magnanimity) to pick out a specific character trait. But the more important connection to this tradition of thought lies in his notion of human greatness (particularly greatness of ‘soul’, as he puts it inÂ Beyond Good and Evil). The chapter works through, and comments on, what Nietzsche regards as some of the central marks of this greatness. It then turns to two further reflections: first, it looks at Nietzsche’s relation to Aristotle on this issue, and how similar the AristotelianÂ megalopsychosÂ is to the Nietzschean great individual. Second, the chapter considers the tension that Nietzsche—unlike most figures in this tradition—apparently sees between greatness and moral goodness and how exactly this tension should be understood.",
