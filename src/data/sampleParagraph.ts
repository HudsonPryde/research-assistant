This is the antithesis of the values developed by those ‘slaves’ conquered by these ‘noble’ warriors, the ‘slaves’ performed a revaluation of their master's values, they say: “the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good; the suffering, deprived, sick, ugly alone are pious, alone are blessed by God, blessedness is for them alone—and you, the powerful and noble, are on the contrary the evil, the cruel, the lustful, the insatiable, the godless to all eternity; and you shall be in all eternity the unblessed, accursed, and damned!”² With this inversion of morals began the two-thousand-year war of ideology waged by the slaves against their masters, which Nietzsche calls: ‘the slave revolt in morality.’ This Christian, or more broadly ‘priestly,’ idea of morality that one is born sinful and must spend their life atoning for that sin of existence and only then can they be forgiven and welcomed into Heaven belittles humanity as something to be overcome and is inherently a pessimistic worldview. Nietzsche believed that subscribing to this pessimistic, religious, worldview will naturally lead to the mass adoption of nihilism as the masses become disillusioned with Christianity and lose their objective meaning to life. When one suffers the loss of their objective values and is faced with the prospects of nihilism, they will try to stave off their succumbing by replacing their old values with new ones, typically secular ones. These modern secular moral valuations often come in the form of social movements, Nietzsche saw this plainly in his day as people flocked to their movement of choice, be it totalitarian, communist, or socialist. This mass move to ideological groups can be felt in most generations as the young realize the values of their parents and institutions are not objective and don’t hold the answers they seek. A couple of great examples of this phenomenon in recent history are the ‘free love’ movement as well as the ‘cult boom’ of the 1970s. Both were instigated by the brutal Vietnam war fought by the U.S., the young of that generation witnessed the horrors that the state they were taught to look up to could inflict, and in turn became disillusioned with American values and looked elsewhere for answers. At the heart of all these movements is the desire to change the world, to create a utopia on earth in replacement of the one Christianity promised existed beyond our world. Nietzsche thought this desire stemmed from the deep-rooted idea that humanity must be saved from its wickedness, This ‘fear of man,’ this rejection of humanity as it is, and the need to find meaning in the suffering it causes, has brought about a form of nihilism in the modern world Nietzsche refers to as: ‘passive nihilism.’ A passive nihilist is a nihilist that doesn’t have the strength to overcome their nihilism, Nietzsche compares this lack of strength to weariness, this weary person desires comfort above all else and has contented themself with the idea that the goal of life is the avoidance of suffering. This passive nihilist is a precursor to Nietzsche's idea of the ‘last man.’"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1}],"direction":null,"format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}}`
