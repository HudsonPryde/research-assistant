## Overview
Hi! This is a research assistant web app I made using Cohere and NextJs.
I plan on adding more features targeted towards analyzing persuasive writing, 
grading arguments and suggesting improvements in the form of claim expansion and argument inversion.

## Installation
1. npm i
2. docker pull redis
3. npm run dev

## Usage
Just start writing in the text editor and periodically run the document scanner from the toolbar.
Hover over the highlighted claims to find sources.
